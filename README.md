# Pokerbots Reimu

A poker bot implementation for Build4Good.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install cython
   ```

3. Try to install eval7:
   ```
   pip install eval7
   ```

   Note: There might be issues installing eval7 due to Cython dependency problems. If you encounter errors, you might need to look for alternative approaches or build the poker bot without eval7.

## Project Structure

- `reimu/player.py` - Main bot implementation
- `skeleton/` - Core game engine components

## Running the Bot

[Add instructions for running the bot once the setup is complete]
